<body><h1>CS25100: Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2017</h1>
<h1>Project 1, Percolation</h1>

<hr>


<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Percolation is a scientific model that is used to analyze the connectivity of systems. For example, it can be used to analyze if a
porous landscape with water on the surface will eventually allow the water to drain through to the bottom. It can be used
to analyze if oil would be able to reach the surface in a similar manner. The idea of the model is to analyze what conditions are necessary
for the system to percolate (i.e. let the water or oil through).

</p><p>
The current assignment will allow students to apply the union-find data structure to solve this problem. The system will be represented as
a <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid where each cell can be in one of 3 states: blocked (black), open (white) or full (blue).
A grid where percolation has been achieved will have a path of full cells from the surface to the bottom.

As can be observed in the examples, the flow of the material goes from top to bottom and each cell routes that flow through the top, left,
right and bottom neighbors. A system where at least one bottom-row cell is full (thanks to the flow route) is said to percolate.

<h2>Tasks</h2>

The current project will be divided into 3 programming tasks and an analysis phase that will require code
simulation, experimental evaluation, and discussion of the results.

It is expected that students will use the <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/introcs/stdlib">standard library</a>
provided by the authors of the course textbook, along with the suggested implementations for union-find data structures in Algorithm 1.5 (Chapter 1).
The standard library JAR file can be directly accessed <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs251/projects/project1/stdlib.jar">here</a> and basic instructions on how to execute programs using it are
<a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs251/projects/project1/instructions.txt">here</a>.

<h3>Percolation API</h3>

Develop a Java class called <code>Percolation</code> that complies with the following interface:

<ul>
<li><code>public Percolation(int n)</code>: Create a new n by n grid where all cells are initially blocked
</li><li><code>public void open(int x, int y)</code>: Open the site at coordinate (x,y), where x represents the horizontal axis and y the vertical one.
For consistency purposes, (0,0) will be the bottom-left cell of the grid and (n-1,n-1) will be on the top-right.
The graphical capabilities discussed later assume a similar convention.
</li><li><code>public boolean isOpen(int x, int y)</code>: Returns true if cell (x,y) is open due to a previous call to open(int x, int y)
</li><li><code>public boolean isFull(int x, int y)</code>: Returns true if there is a path from cell (x,y) to the surface (i.e. there is percolation up to this cell)
</li><li><code>public boolean percolates()</code>: Analyzes the entire grid and returns true if the whole system percolates
</li><li><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>: Create a main method that reads a description of a grid from standard input (using <code>StdIn.java</code>)
and validates if the system described percolates or not, printing to standard output a simple "Yes" or "No" answer (using StdOut.java).
<pre>	%java Percolation &lt; gridpercolates.txt
	Yes

	%java Percolation &lt; griddoesntpercolate.txt
	No
</pre>

The input file format is simple: the first line contains the value of n, as in the Percolation constructor parameter, and a variable number
of extra lines, each containing a cell coordinate, following the format <em> "&lt;x-value&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;y-value&gt;"</em>. The program should open the sites
in the same order they appear in the file and print the final result after processing all of them.
Sample files can be found <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs251/projects/project1/samples.tgz">here</a>.
</li></ul>

<h3>Visualization</h3>

Create a program called <code>PercolationVisualizer.java</code> that receives an input file the same way <code>Percolation.java</code> does but, instead of displaying a Yes/No answer,
it will graphically show the process of opening each of the sites one after another similar to <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cs251/projects/project1/percolation20-by-20.mov">this example</a>.
The call to that program should be <pre>	%java PercolationVisualizer &lt; input.txt </pre>

<p>
In order to produce the visualization, students can use the API provided through StdDraw.java in the book standard library. By default, all drawings on the canvas are based on unit-square coordinate values, which means that all coordinate values go from 0 to 1 (0,0 bottom-left corner and 1,1 top-right). It is suggested that these coordinate boundaries are used and that cell sizes be adjusted to fractions between 0 and 1 depending on the grid size.

</p><p>
For grading purposes only small-sized grids will be used (up to N=20) thus, although Percolation.java should handle any grid size theoretically, the visualization will only be checked using that size range. It is suggested that a window size of around 600x600 is used.

</p><h3>Simulation</h3>
In a famous scientific problem, researchers are interested in the following question: if sites are independently set to be open with probability
<em>p</em> (and therefore blocked with probability 1 - <em>p</em>), what is the probability that the system percolates?
When <em>p</em> is 0, the system never percolates; when <em>p</em> is 1, the system always percolates.
The plots below show the site vacancy probability <em>p</em> versus the percolation probability for 20-by-20 random grid (left) and 100-by-100 random grid (right).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</center>

When <em>N</em> is sufficiently large, there is a threshold value <em>p</em>* such that when <em>p</em> &lt; <em>p</em>* a random <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid almost never percolates, and when <em>p</em> &gt; <em>p</em>*, a random <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em> grid almost always percolates. No mathematical solution for determining the percolation threshold <em>p</em>* has yet been derived. In this project the threshold will be estimated using Monte Carlo simulations.
<p>
To do so, create a program called <code>PercolationStats.java</code> that will generate systems randomly connected that can be used to estimate <em>p</em>*. More specifically, do the following:
</p><ul>
	<li>Create a grid of size NxN where all cells are blocked initially
	</li><li>Randomly select a blocked cell and open it (use <code>StdRandom.uniform</code>)
	</li><li>Repeat the previous step until the system percolates
	</li><li>Count the number of open cells and use that to obtain the <em>p</em>* estimate. For example, if for a grid of size 5x5 10 cells were opened, the estimate will be 0.4 (10/25). In general, <em>p</em>*= num cells / N^2.
</li></ul>

The previous process can be repeated multiple times to obtain various estimates and the different values can be used to calculate a mean and standard deviation using the methods in StdStats.java. To calculate the mean, create an array of double values (double[]) that will hold each of the estimates. Once all estimates have been calculated call StdStats.mean(double[]) to obtain the mean value. To calculate the standard deviation use that same array and call <code>StdStats.stddev(double[])</code>.
<p>
The main method in PercolationStats will receive three command line parameters, <em>N</em>, <em>T</em> and <em>type</em>, that will indicate the program to perform <em>T</em> repetitions of the previous process for a grid of size <em>N</em>-by-<em>N</em>. The type parameter will be a string, either slow or fast, which will determine the type of union method to be used. Algorithm 1.5 mentions 3 types of modifications that can be used to implement the union-find data structure. For this project, students will need to take into account quick find (slow) and the weighted quick union (fast). Depending on which parameter is given to the program a different implementation of the data structure should be used and it should reflect a distinct performance change from one to the other.
</p><p>
The output of the program should include the mean percolation threshold and the corresponding standard deviation. Additionally, it should output the total execution time of all experiments, the mean time for each experiment and its standard deviation (you can use Stopwatch.java). The following example shows a call that intends to run 50 simulations with a grid size of 20, using the weighted quick union method (the values after the = should be actual values in your program):

</p><pre>	%java PercolationStats 20 50 fast
	mean threshold=the_threshold_value
	std dev=the_threshold_stddev
	time=total_time_in_seconds
	mean time=mean_time_in_seconds
	stddev time=stddev_time_in_second
</pre>

<h4>Analysis</h4>

Using <code>PercolationStats.java</code>, analyze the consequences of using different values of <em>N</em> and each of the two modifications to the data structure. Make a qualitative analysis of using <em>T</em>=30 and <em>N</em>={10,25,50,100,250,500}, for each of the two methods. What differences can be found in terms of execution time? What is the behavior of the estimates of <em>p</em>*?
<p>
Create a PDF file named yourName_yourSurname.pdf with your analysis and submit it along with your source code.
Your report should include the following two plots:

</p><ul>
<li><b>Running time:</b> Plot N on the x-axis and mean run time on the y-axis. You should show one line for the slow implementation and another for the fast one.
</li><li><b><em>p</em>* estimates:</b> Plot N on the x-axis and and mean <em>p</em>* on the y-axis. One line for each implementation.
</li></ul>

Besides those plots you should include your discussion of the results found.

<h3>Submission</h3>
Submit your solution before <b>Monday, September 11, 11:59pm</b>. <code>turnin</code> will be used to submit assignments.
<p>
Create a folder where you will include all source code and libraries used. The report should be included in that folder, too. Finally, provide a <code>README</code> file with your name, instructions to compile and run your code (Please do not use absolute paths, or at least tell how to modify it to compile without problems) and anything you would like us to know about your program (like errors, special conditions, etc).
</p><p>
After logging into <code>data.cs.purdue.edu</code>, please follow these steps to submit your assignment:
</p><ul>
<li>Make a directory named <code>yourName_yourSurname</code> and copy all of your files there.
</li><li>While in the upper level directory (if the files are in <code>/homes/jsmith/john_smith</code>, go to <code>/homes/jsmith</code>), execute the following command:
<pre>	%turnin -c cs251 -p project1 your_folder_name
</pre>
(<em>e.g.</em>, <code>turnin -c cs251 -p project1 john_smith</code>) Keep in mind that old submissions are overwritten with new ones whenever you execute this command.
You can verify the contents of your submission by executing the following command:
<pre>	%turnin -v -c cs251 -p project1
</pre>
Do not forget the -v flag here, as otherwise your submission would be replaced with an empty one.
</li></ul>
<p>
Since you will need to use 2 implementations of union-find, for the purposes of grading, submit your <code>Percolation.java</code> file using the weighted quick union find implementation.
